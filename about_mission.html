    <h1>
        Our Mission
    </h1>

    <p>The mission of Blue Leaf Corporation is to create an <font color="dodgerblue">environmentally friendly</font> subscription box of hygiene products that would fill the needs of the growing number of conscious young adults. In the twenty-first century, the conditions of our Earth grew worse and worse due to the use of <font color="red">fossil fuels</font> and for the lack of care from large corporations in trying to conserve the resources we have left. In recent years, there was a growth of young consumers who are trying to use environmentally-friendly products to save the Earth. The problems they often face is that their product is more expensive than regular, destructive products because they take more care to manufacture and that these products also take a long time to find since they are not common and can be falsely advertised. This corporation is made with the mission to encourage and spread the use of these environmentally-friendly products by making these products <font color="orange">cheaper</font> and more <font color="orange">easily accessible</font>. We intend to provide a cheaper alternative to buying full-size products and also save time for consumers who would usually take a long time to look at the ingredients and choose a product at the store. In addition, these eco-friendly products ranging from soaps to shampoo to lotion are from well-known and well-researched brands which Blue Leaf Corporation can guarantee are environmentally friendly. Overall, we hope to allow making shopping for these environmentally-friendly products accessible and affordable.</p>
